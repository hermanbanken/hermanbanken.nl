In the last few months this blog started to generate a lot more traffic than before. Mostly via the tweets from my fellow student ([@veeence][1]) but my site also gained a few returning visitors interested in the Mac server scene. As these folks started to test my scripts posted here they found found some bugs and posted some comments. One of them is Sean and today I&#8217;m announcing Sean as a new writer for this site.

Sean will mostly write about Mac server imitation implementations, complete with Single Sign On and Windows support. But of course he can write about whatever he wants if it&#8217;s only a little bit relavant for you guys!

So stay tuned and if you like the blog, subscribe for the [RSS feed][2]!
