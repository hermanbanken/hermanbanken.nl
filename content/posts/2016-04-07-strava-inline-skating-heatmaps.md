Inline skating is one of my favourite things to do during summer, and I love to explore new routes. With skates however the road quality is very important. If the asphalt has too much gravel the skates shake heavily and the experience is awful.

Strava, logging activities for cycling and running has had <a href="http://labs.strava.com/heatmap" target="_blank">Heatmaps</a> for quite some time. Also their <a href="http://www.strava.com/routes/new" target="_blank">Route Planner</a> integrates the same data and uses \*popularity\* to snap routes to frequently traveled roads. However, this uses cycling and running data only.

Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if Strava adds the option to view Heatmaps for inline skating too? And plan routes and use popularity of roads for a generic sport instead of just cycling and running? I think so!

I contacted Strava and will update this blog with reactions I receive. Fingers crossed!
