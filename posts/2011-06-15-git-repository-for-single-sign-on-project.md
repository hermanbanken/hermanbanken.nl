When I first made my installer for OpenLDAP I did this for my own convenience. But while doing so I realized the script could be useful for more people and I published it on my blog. Then it became big, and I invited Sean to write for my blog about this project. For Sean and you guys I just made a git repository on GitHub so anyone can edit the installer to be the best (and first) SSO-installer ever.

So please help this project and fork the project at <https://github.com/hermanbanken/Ultimate-Single-Sign-On-Enviroment-Installer>.
