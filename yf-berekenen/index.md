I am a speed skater on the 400m track on ice. In some states there is a special class for people who skate hard enough to get to regional/national championships. These people get Ice Privileges or, in Dutch, IJsfaciliteiten. According to your personals records you get rewarded with these IP. To calculate how much you need to improve to get IP you can use the calculators below.
